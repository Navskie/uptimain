                SangHwang mushroom is well-known as a precious medicinal ingredient with an excellent anti-cancer effect and as a herb of eternal youth resurrecting the dead according to an ancient book “Bonghwangrok”. It is also recorded as Sangmogi (Mulberry Tree Mushroom) in the part of Tangaek of the book “Donguibogam”. In addition, its shape looks like a mud lump at the early growing stage, then a tongue sticking out from a tree stump after the growth and thus called Soosul (Tree Tongue).
